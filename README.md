# Neural-Style-Transfer-with-PyTorch
Coursera Guided Project

An implementation of neural style transfer using PyTorch.

**Neural style transfer** is a technique used to take `content image` and `style image` and blend them together so that the output image looks like the `content image` but painted in the style of the `style image`
